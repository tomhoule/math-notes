== Magnitude

The magnitude of a complex number $z = a + b i$ is defined as $|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)$.

== Argument

For any complex number, like $z = 3 + 4i$, there is $arg(z)$ that is the angle (in radians) between the $x$ axis and the complex number in the Argand diagram.

So for $z$:

$
  tan theta &= 4/3\
  theta &= arctan(4/3)\
        &approx 0.93
$
