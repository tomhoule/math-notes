= Circles

*Circumference*: $2 pi r$\
*Surface*: $pi r^2$

= Cylinders

*Surface*: $2 pi r^2 + 2 pi r h$\
*Volume*: $V = pi r ^2 h$

= Spheres

*Surface*: $4 pi r^2$
*Volume*: $4/3 pi r^3$

= Triangles

== Surface

The formula for the area of a triangle from one angle $C$ and its two adjacent sides $a$ and $b$ is:

$
  1/2 a b sin C
$

$C$ is called the *included angle*.

= Polygons

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is always $180 * (n-2)$ where $n$ is the number of sides.

== Regular polygons

With $n$ as the number of sides, exterior angles are given by:

$theta = 360/n$
