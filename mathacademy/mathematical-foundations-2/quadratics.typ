== Forms

- Standard form: $y = a x^2 + b x + c$
- Vertex form: $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$
  - In this form, the coordinates of the vertex are $(h, k)$
- Factored form: $y = a(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$

== Vertex

If the binomial is given in standard form, the vertex' $x$ coordinate is given by $-b / (2a)$. Once you have the $x$ coordinate, substitute in the equation to find $y$.

== Domain and range

The *domain* is always $( - infinity, + infinity )$.

The *range* is, for upward opening parabolas
