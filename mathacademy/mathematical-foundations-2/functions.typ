== Horizontal asymptotes of rational functions

Rational functions are of the form:

$ f(x) = (a x^n + b x^(n-1) + ...) / (c x ^ m + d x ^ (m-1) + ...) $

To get the horizontal asymptotes, you first take the *dominant term* It's the leading term of the polynomial in the denominator, _without the coefficient_. Here $x^m$.

Then, you divide every term in both numerator and denominator, and evaluate at $x -> infinity$.
